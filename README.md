Part 1: Theoretical Analysis (40%)
Q1: How Edge AI reduces latency and enhances privacy compared to cloud-based AI
Explanation:

Latency reduction: Edge AI processes data locally on devices (e.g., smartphones, drones, IoT devices), so there’s no need to send data to the cloud for analysis, drastically reducing communication delays. This is critical for real-time applications like autonomous drones that must react instantly to environmental changes.

Privacy enhancement: Since data is processed locally, sensitive information doesn’t leave the device, minimizing exposure risks compared to cloud processing where data travels over networks and is stored on centralized servers.
Example: Autonomous drones for disaster monitoring analyze video feeds in real-time at the edge, enabling immediate obstacle avoidance without latency caused by cloud communication, and keeping location data private.

Q2: Quantum AI vs. Classical AI in solving optimization problems
Comparison:

Classical AI: Uses traditional algorithms running on classical computers, which may take exponential time for certain optimization problems as the problem size grows.

Quantum AI: Utilizes quantum computing principles like superposition and entanglement to explore multiple solutions simultaneously, potentially solving complex optimization problems exponentially faster.
Industries benefiting:

Pharmaceuticals: Faster drug discovery via quantum-enhanced molecular simulations.

Finance: Optimizing portfolios and risk management more efficiently.

Logistics: Solving complex routing and supply chain optimization problems.

Q3: Societal impact of Human-AI collaboration in healthcare
Transformation of roles: AI assists healthcare workers rather than replacing them, e.g., radiologists get AI-powered tools that highlight suspicious regions in scans, improving diagnostic accuracy and speed. Nurses can use AI for monitoring patient vitals and predicting emergencies.

Benefits: Enhances decision-making, reduces burnout, allows focus on patient care and empathy.

Challenges: Requires training healthcare workers to work effectively alongside AI, addressing trust and ethical concerns.

Case Study Critique: AI in Smart Cities (AI-IoT for Traffic Management)
Improvement in urban sustainability:

AI analyzes real-time data from IoT sensors (e.g., traffic cameras, vehicle counters) to optimize traffic lights and reduce congestion, lowering emissions and improving air quality.

Predictive analytics help in proactive maintenance and infrastructure planning, improving resource efficiency.

Challenges:

Data security: Large-scale sensor networks increase vulnerability to cyberattacks.

Privacy: Continuous monitoring raises concerns over citizens’ data privacy.
